In a few cases you would need to define the function that return a Zero element. Zero element is the element which has the following features:

1. The sum or subtraction with zero zero of some element remain value unchanged.
2. Multiplication by zero makes zero.
3. Division by zero is not defined.

`Sample` type has `ZeroSample` constant defined, all numeric value has their usual zero values which can be used for that purpose.
